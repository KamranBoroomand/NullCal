        <h3>Design philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Every surface is built with negative space, soft gradients, and
          luminous accents to keep attention on what matters most.

        <h3>Built for velocity</h3>
        <p>
          Fast transitions, smart caching, and lightweight components keep
          NullCAL responsive even for dense schedules.
